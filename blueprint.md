# 🚀 Super-Gemini: Blueprint

Super-Gemini is a **local-first, agentic AI system** designed to run on Android and act as a **universal developer + productivity agent**.
It combines **Gemini Pro reasoning**, **bash/python/node runtimes**, and **agentic control** to create, execute, and manage tasks — from chat assistance to building full-stack web applications.

---

## 🎯 Vision

- **Android-first agent**: Works as a local chatbot, powered by Gemini.
- **Developer companion**: Can scaffold, run, and deploy full-stack apps.
- **Autonomous executor**: Plans, executes, and iterates on tasks.
- **Universal tool**: Acts as a coder, researcher, and automation agent.
- **Offline ready**: Includes pre-setup runtime stack (bash, python, node).

---

## 🏗 Architecture

1. **Android Layer**
   - Native Android App (Kotlin/React Native)
   - Local chatbot interface
   - Connects to Termux runtime

2. **Agentic Brain**
   - Powered by Gemini Pro 2.5 (API)
   - Planner–Executor loop for autonomy
   - Hidden chain-of-thought, user sees only final actions

3. **Execution Engine**
   - GNU Bash shell
   - Python runtime (data, scripts, AI libs)
   - Node.js runtime (webapps, APIs)
   - SQLite/Postgres client for DB tasks

4. **WebApp Builder**
   - Scaffolds React/Next.js/Laravel/Svelte apps
   - Runs locally via Termux
   - Deploys via GitHub Actions → Vercel/Render

5. **Memory System**
   - JSON-based vector store for embeddings
   - `preferences.json` for user personalization
   - Supports long-term adaptive memory

6. **Toolbox**
   - Filesystem read/write
   - Browser integration (search + fetch)
   - API caller (REST/GraphQL)
   - Emulator/VM control

## 📅 Phased Development

### **Phase 1: Foundation**
- Android app with Gemini chat interface
- Termux runtime pre-setup (`setup.sh`)
- Core tools: bash, python, node

### **Phase 2: Agentic Control**
- Implement planner–executor loop
- Tool integrations: FS, APIs, DB
- Local embedding memory

### **Phase 3: WebApp Autonomy**
- Auto-generate frontend + backend projects
- Run locally on Android
- Deploy via GitHub Actions + Vercel

### **Phase 4: Universal Agent**
- Control Android emulator/VM
- Automate apps & system-level tasks
- Add multimodal (voice + image + text)

---

## 🛣 Roadmap

- ✅ Define repo structure
- 🔄 Implement setup.sh auto installer
- 🔄 Build minimal Android chat app
- 🔜 Add planner–executor core loop
- 🔜 Expand to webapp builder
- 🔜 Add universal agent features

---

## ✨ Long-Term Vision

Super-Gemini evolves into a **Manus-style Android-native AI IDE + Agent**, capable of:
- Acting as a **self-contained developer environment**
- Building + deploying apps with zero setup
- Serving as a **personal AI operating system** for Android
